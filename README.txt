This little amazing text mode game was published 
by Al Sweigart in his book named 
"Invent your own computer games with Python". 

Now it is is rewritten for the C++ programming 
language, primarily for my own fun and then to be 
able to run this game on any computer, even one that 
does not have a Python interpreter installed.
